
My project is a comprehensive Tweet sentiment analysis model that employs advanced techniques, including a 6-layer neural network with dropout in every 2 layers and handling imbalanced data using weighted training. The core of the model's power lies in its utilization of DistilBERT, specifically the DistilBERT base sentence transformer, to encode text and compute probabilities for sentiment prediction.

To begin, I collected a large dataset of labeled tweets, ensuring diversity in sentiments expressed, and divided it into training and testing sets. During training, the model achieved an impressive 86% accuracy, showcasing its ability to learn and generalize from the provided data. However, to ascertain the model's robustness and avoid overfitting, it was crucial to assess its performance on unseen data as well. In the testing phase, the model maintained a commendable accuracy of 72%, demonstrating its capability to handle new, real-world tweets effectively.

The neural network architecture comprises six layers, designed to extract high-level features from the input tweet texts progressively. To prevent overfitting and enhance generalization, dropout was introduced at every two layers. This technique randomly deactivates certain neurons during training, thus reducing the network's dependency on specific connections and making it more resilient to noise and variations.

One of the challenges in sentiment analysis arises from imbalanced data, where one sentiment class may have significantly more samples than others. To address this issue, I utilized weighted training, assigning higher importance to underrepresented classes during optimization. This ensures the model does not favor majority classes and remains sensitive to minority sentiments, resulting in a more balanced and reliable sentiment prediction.

Additionally, to facilitate the model's understanding of textual information, I one-hot encoded all sentiment labels, transforming them into categorical representations. By converting the labels into a suitable format, the model can better interpret the sentiment categories and make informed predictions.

The incorporation of DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT, as the base sentence transformer elevates the model's performance significantly. DistilBERT retains much of BERT's capability but is much faster and more memory-efficient, making it ideal for real-time applications like sentiment analysis.

In conclusion, my tweet sentiment analysis project showcases cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing and deep learning. The 6-layer neural network with dropout, handling of imbalanced data using weights, and leveraging the power of DistilBERT base sentence transformer results in a robust and accurate sentiment analysis system that can benefit various domains, from social media monitoring to market research and customer feedback analysis.
